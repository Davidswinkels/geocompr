# Introduction 

- From the course's home at [github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/blob/master/course-info/intro-info.Rmd) and the CDRC website:


This one day course will get you up-to-speed with using R and RStudio for daily working with spatial data.
You will learn about R's powerful geospatial data processing, analysis and visualisation capabilities.
It is practical and hands-on: you'll *learn by doing*.
It assumes you already use R and want to extend your knowledge for spatial data applications.
It will cover the recently developed **sf** package, which is compatible with the **tidyverse**, representing the cutting-edge of spatial data applications.
It will provide a solid foundation (including spatial aggregation, joining, CRSs, visualisation) on which advanced analysis analysis workflows can be built.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

# Learning outcomes

By the end of the course participants will:

 - Understand R's spatial ecosystem and which packages are 'future proof'
 - Know how to optimise RStudio for productive working with spatial data (you should already be proficient with RStudio)
 - Be able to read and write a variety of spatial data formats
 - Be proficient at common spatial operations including subsetting, cropping, aggregation and transformation
 - Be a confident map maker using the powerful **tmap** package
 - Know where to look for learning more advanced methods

# Prerequisites

In preparation for the course you should:

- Ensure that you have the latest versions of R and RStudio installed on your laptop: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
- Brush up on your R skills if you're not an R user, e.g. with:
    - This excellent tutorial that you can work through to get used to the interface: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r
    - A more detailed account by Gillespie and Lovelace (2017): https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio
- Take a look at how GitHub works - we'll be using it for sharing course materials and sharing links and examples during the course, e.g. by reading this page (and following the tutorial if really keen): https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

# Test your set-up

This should work:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(spData)
```



```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("spData")
```

## Course materials

The course will be based on Chapter 4 of [Geocomputation with R](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/attr.html) of the forethcoming book *Geocomputation with R* plus some additional materials:

- An introduction to geographic data in R
    - Chapter 2 of [Geocomputation with R](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/spatial-class.html)
- Geographic data I/O
    - Chapter 5 of [Geocomputation with R](http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/read-write.html)
- Introduction to visualising spatial data with R
    - [Creating-maps-in-R](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R) GitHub tutorial
- Point pattern analysis and rasterization
    - [Point Pattern analysis and spatial interpolation with R
](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/blob/master/vignettes/point-pattern.md) from the previous tutorial

# R's spatial ecosystem

```{r cranlogs, fig.cap="The popularity of spatial packages in R. The y-axis shows the average number of downloads, within a 30-day rolling window, of R's top 5 spatial packages, defined as those with the highest number of downloads last month.", echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("http://robinlovelace.net/geocompr/figures/spatial-package-growth.png")
```

---

# Before spatial packages...

- Coordinates were treated as *just another variable*
- Issues with visualisation, spatial relations and consistency
- Major issues with Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs)

```{r}
library(spData)
data(package = "spData")
?afcon
```

```{r, fig.asp=0.5}
plot(afcon$x, afcon$y)
```

---

# sp

- Released in 2005 (Pebesma and Bivand 2005)
- Raster and vector data (but mostly raster) supported
- We *won't* be using it but it *is* useful to know about ()

```{r}
library(sp)
data(meuse)
coords = SpatialPoints(meuse[c("x", "y")])
meuse = SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords, meuse)
str(meuse)
```

---

# sp visuals

```{r}
plot(meuse, pch=1, cex = .05*sqrt(meuse$zinc))
```



# sf

# raster
