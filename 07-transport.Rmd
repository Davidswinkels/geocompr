# Transport applications

In no other sector is geographic space more tangible than transport.
It is the effort of moving, particularly between places that are far apart, that led to the 'first law' of geography defined by Waldo Tobler in 1970 as follows [@miller_toblers_2004]: 

> Everything  is related  to  everything  else,  but  near  things  are more  related  than  distant  things

This 'law', which applies to phenomena as diverse as friendship networks and ecological diversity, can be explained by the costs of transport --- in terms of time, energy and money --- otherwise known as the 'friction of distance'.
Transport is an inherently geospatial activity: by definition it involves traversing continuous geographic space between A and B, and infinite localities in between.
It is therefore unsurprising that geocomputation offers much to transport research, and that transport problems are a motivator of geocomputational methods.
